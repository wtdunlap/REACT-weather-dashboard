## Local on the Eights - Weather

This is a simple weather app that has been rebuilt from vanilla JS and HTML with CSS, to use React and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

When a city is entered in the search bar, and the search button is pressed, local weather details for the city name will be displayed and the city name will be stored in local storage for ease of access when returning. A total of five cities will be saved and the oldest search will be removed when a new search is performed.
